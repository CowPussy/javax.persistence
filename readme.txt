Java(TM) Persistence API, Version 2.1
This is an implementation of an early-draft specification developed under the
Java Community Process (JCP).  The code is untested and presumed not to be a
compatible implementation of JSR 338: Java(TM) Persistence 2.1.
We encourage you to migrate to an implementation of the Java(TM) Persistence
API, Version 2.1 Specification that has been tested and verified to be compatible
as soon as such an implementation is available, and we encourage you to retain
this notice in any implementation of Java(TM) Persistence API, Version 2.1
Specification that you distribute.
