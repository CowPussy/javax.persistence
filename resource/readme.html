Java(TM) Persistence API, Version 2.1 - EARLY ACCESS
This is an implementation of an early-draft specification developed under the 
Java Community Process (JCP).  The code is untested and presumed not to be a  
compatible implementation of JSR 338: Java(TM) Persistence 2.1.   
We encourage you to migrate to an implementation of the Java(TM) Persistence 
API, Version 2.1 Specification that has been tested and verified to be compatible 
as soon as such an implementation is available, and we encourage you to retain 
this notice in any implementation of Java(TM) Persistence API, Version 2.1 
Specification that you distribute.
